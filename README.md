# Audio-Player-App-with-Play-and-Stop-Buttons
This project is for implementing audio playback functionality in iOS applications using the AVFoundation framework. It demonstrates the usage of UIButton and AVPlayer for controlling audio playback within the application.<br><br>

-The application features an audio player functionality with two buttons: Play and Stop.<br><br>
-The Play button allows users to play an audio file (named "audio_file.mp3" in the project's bundle) using AVFoundation's AVPlayer. Upon clicking the Play button, the audio starts playing.<br><br>
-The Stop button, when clicked, pauses the audio playback and resets the player's time back to the beginning, effectively stopping the audio.<br><br>
-The user interface elements, including the buttons, are created programmatically within the ViewController class.
